		<p class="indent">The point of the AppInventor project was to get the feel of using AppInventor. The objective of our game idea was to make a more challenging version of an already created game. We used <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu" target="_blank">MIT App Inventor</a> in order to edit the game. AppInventor is a lot similar to <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>, a programming language. However, MIT AI has more coding abilities than Scratch. In our project, the objective was to take a game that included a tutorial, and improve or add more features to it. In the game we chose, the original was slow paced, so we wanted to make the game go faster everytime a level was beaten. We also planned to add different types of birds that could be used during gameplay. These two plans were accomplished with little bugs in the game. Our third plan, which we didn't complete, was to add a leaderboard screen. This plan didn't work because codes didn't transfer from one screen to another. However, the final product was still a work well done.</p>

				<h3 class="text-center"><strong>Scratch Project</strong></h3>
				<p style="padding-left: 50px;" class="indent">The purpose of our Scratch project was to get used to using algorithims. My partner and I wanted to create a simple, yet challenging game. Our game was a maze that would make the player restart if they touched the sides. This project was fun because it introduced us to the world of coding. Also, we were free to make whatever we wanted using Scratch, giving us freedom and allowing us to create what interested us.

		<h3 class="text-center"><strong>Text Adventure Project</strong></h3>
		<p class="indent" style="padding-left: 50px;">This was our first project involving the use of Python. The objective of this project was to use Python to develop an interactive text based game. My partner and I came up with many ideas, but we chose the idea of having the player pass though levels by answering riddles. My role of the project was to find riddles and help my partner code. A challenge that we crossed upon was the inability to use loops. That was a restraint of the project, and it slowed us down as our code was repeated over and over again. My partner and I worked really well together because we helped each other out when needed.</p>
